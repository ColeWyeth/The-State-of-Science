<h1> The Advancement of Science </h1>

<p> Science is a neglected field. This is not obvious, because it is used for most things, and it has improved life through many advancements. The neglect of science rests in the common sentiment that it has no place in certain areas or that there are some questions it can't answer. </p>
<p> The scientific method is really the only method of thinking that is functional. It is based on <em> actually checking </em> what is true. It provides evidence for its claims, and it is concerned with finding out the truth. When scientific research is banned as unethical, particularly for religious reasons, it tends to hold us back from our potential ascension. </p>
<p> A great example is objection to stem cell research. Stem cell research has literally no negative impacts whatsoever. Objections are based entirely in ridiculous supernatural claims or the idea that "Science shoudln't be allowed to tamper with that." If stem cell research had more funding, particularly in America, a lot of ailments could be cured. It might even be possible to regrow limbs (finally). <p>
<p> After thousands of years of human existence, our achievements are underwhelming. A lot of time has been wasted on superstition, war, and leisure. The human lifespan is still relatively very short; many less "advanced" lifeforms outlive us. We are still prone to disease and aging. Both have potential solutions. Neither has been cured. We still use primitive fuels, and we haven't worked out the laws of physics completely. We don't know exactly how the universe began or how it will end.</p>
<div id="EoU">
<p> Two leading theories are that the universe will end in heat death or a "big crunch." Heat death is the currently accepted one. It claims that the universe will basically be scattered throughout space until even the black holes die. </p>
</div> 
<p> The solution to these problems is definitely not simple to implement, though it is partially easily to formulate. A larger science budget and better schools massively supported by the government would solve the problem. Certain political figures tend to be opposed to this (perhaps because an educated population would be less likely to vote for them) so it is very hard to acheive. </p>
<p> With the advent of the internet it has become possible for a person to absorb an incredible amount of knowledge for practically no cost. It is now feasible that everyone could have a wide knowledge base as well as deep specialization, and society would be far more productive.<br/> Instead, most people just play video games and watch TV. </p>
<h2> The Future </h2>
<p> The fate of humanity is not yet decided, but our low average knowledge level may well be fatal. Science might not advance fast enough to save us from our ignorance. We might drive ourselves extinct. </p>
<p> This can be prevented. A highly pro-science world power government would be capable of solving the issues we've created and sending us to the stars. NASA only gets a tiny fraction of the budget of the US military. Think what it could do with triple the funding. Or even twenty times the funding. If we switched to renewable energy we'd be able to power all of our experiments, and we wouldn't need a military to go around securing us more oil. </p>
<p> War is another problem of the world that arises from the clashing of nations and religions. Whole countries are to busy massacring civilians to contribute to science. The US military only makes it worse (in general). </p>
